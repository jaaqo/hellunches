Simple webscraper with a React.js frontend to display lunches from restaurants I
often use.

### `npm run server:dev`

Runs the express server that is responsible for webscraping the menus. By
default at port 3001.

### `npm start`

Runs the frontend app in the development mode.<br> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in
the console.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
